Things are nice. Let’s find some and grab them, they might come in handy, who knows?

Use the following API call to get the item at the coordinates your character is standing on (the argument is the id of your character);

/api3/?session=<sessionkey>&command=get&arg=ri4llrZXK

You will soon get an ‘inventory’ update in your scan calls, which lists the current content of your inventory. This information can also be retrieved using the getcharacter APi call.

Add an inventory list next to the character map which lists the names of the items in the current directory.

To drop something from your inventory, use the following call (the fist argument is the id of the item, the second the id of your character);

/api3/?session=<sessionkey>&command=drop&arg=ra0mhhzJi&arg2=ri4llrZXK

Make sure that the inventory lets you select an item and shows an updated view where the dropped item is gone after it is dropped.

Demonstrate how to make two characters exchange an item.
